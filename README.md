## Overview

A responsive milestone email without media queries. Media queries only used for enhancements for email clients that support them.

I have tested the email on 70 plus different devices and email clients. The email works fine in the majority of the email clients.

Please note that I am using 2 gifs in the email and they are not supported in Outlook 2007-2019. They will look distorted if viewed from these
email clients.

Occasionally I have noticed a faint horizontal line going through the footer section in Outlook. I have looked into this and there is no proper fix for this. It has all to do with how Outlook renders your email when you open it. Sometimes it renders it well but occasionally you may see this faint line.

The email works well in dark mode for the majority of email clients that support dark mode. Please note the buttons will not show up in
dark mode for macOS Mojave and macOS Big Sur. I am looking into fixing this issue.

### The challenge

Creating a fully responsive email without media queries. Most email apps support modern CSS and media queries
but there are still many that don't. With this in mind the challenge is to build a responsive email that works for both email clients that
support and for those that do NOT support modern CSS, like media queries. I am using the fluid hybrid method of HTML email development to achieve this.

## My process

- Took inspiration from looking at many milestone emails I found online
- I created a fictitious company and I heavily customised the email content
- I found some non-copyright images and optimised and hosted them online
- I coded the email follwing CSS2 specificaton, using tables, inline CSS and div/media queries for email clients that support them
- Made it look as good as possible for dark mode
- I used Desktop-first approach as that's the best practice for email development
- I tested my email using Email on Acid
- I uploaded the email to the web via Cloudflare

### Built with

- HTML5 markup with CSS2
- An HTML Tag that defines the XML and OOMXML (Office Open XML) which The HTML document needs for the email to work on Outlook on Windows
- An Apple Scaling Meta Tag that prevents any unwanted scaling or zooming from Apple
- An IE9 Meta Tag used for improving rendering in Iternet Explorer 9 or lower
- An XML Tag that ensures that Microsoft Outlook transforms everything in our email to adapt to the screen zoom percentage in Windows
- Inline CSS which is best practice for email as some clients strip out the head tag in emails
- Some media queries within the style tag in the head tag for clients that do support them. This is for enhancement only
- For apps that support modern CSS I am using an outer container in the form of a div which has the use of max-width and display: inline-block
  properties
- For email clients that do not support modern CSS I use Ghost tables which are restrictive table layouts for Outlook email clients
- Divs, max-width and display:inline-block are used for layouts with 2 and more columns. For a single column layout I use tables
- For 2 columns and more I also have a nested div inside each column for padding. This is applied to the ghost table cells for Outlook
- Use of a spacer div and/or td to create space between sections
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

Please note that I am using 2 gifs in the email and they are not supported in Outlook 2007-2019.

When testing I had some issues with the gifs becoming too big for the mobile layout in Outlook. This is because it was displaying the gifs at full size, i.e a width of 100% as I had originally set my images to display in the inline css for the gifs. To solve this I had to just leave the size I wanted in the width HTML attribute that Outlook will display and move the inline gif related css into a media query.

I learnt how to code a responsive email and how to test an email for the various email clients

### Continued development

I will continue to improve and practice coding emails!
